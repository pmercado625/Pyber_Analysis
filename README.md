# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide insight into the various metrics of PyBer customers in various city types. This is done by separating ride-sharing data into 'Urban', "Suburban", and "Rural" types and filtering by date.
## Results

<br /> From the figures produced from the analysis, we can conclude that:
- Urban ride-sharing is the most common type of transaction.
- Conversely, it is also the cheapest of the options, with the average urban fare being ~30% cheaper than rural fares.
- Even though urban ride-sharing is cheaper, it still generates around 8x the total fares that rural drivers generate.
- Urban ride-sharing also has the largest number of drivers, having more than 100x the drivers in rural areas.
- In all of these aspects, suburban ride-sharing is inbetween these two extreme categories.
## Summary
In order to address these disparities, actions that could be taken could include:
- Increasing pay per ride to rural drivers to incentivize doing business in these areas.
- Decrease fare per ride to encourage more rural customers.
- Do nothing, as these figures make sense. The number of people in rural areas pales in comparison to suburban and urban areas. It's only natural that there would be less customers partaking in the service in less populated areas. Additionally, the increased fares are likely due to increased distances between places. That's why it's the cheapest in cities (close proximity) vs rural areas (largers areas to drive through to reach the next destination).
